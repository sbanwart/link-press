link-press
==========

A Python script for taking a set of links and metadata and creating a WordPress linkblog post. This is my first Python program and I'm fairly certain the code is a mess. Hopefully as I learn more about Python this program will get better.

Requirements
------------

* Python 2.7.3
* python-wordpress-xmlrpc 1.5.2
* SQLite3

This was built on Fedora 17 x86_64, but should run on any Linux system with the proper libraries.

Status
------

As I no longer use WordPress, I am not continuing to work on this project. I am archiving this repository on the off chance that somebody wants to fork it and continue working on it.
